PROBLEM DEFINITION

OBJECTIVE
Event management is the process of creating and maintaining an event.
Event managers plan and organize promotional, business and social events.
They're responsible for running a range of events, ensuring the target
audience is engaged and the message of the event is marketed properly.
Events play a huge part in the success of a brand or an organization. This
process spans from the very beginning of planning all the way to post-event
strategizing. At the start, an event manager makes planning decisions, such
as the time, location, and theme of their event. Event managers manage and
coordinate suppliers and all event logistics (for example, decors, catering,
snack)
